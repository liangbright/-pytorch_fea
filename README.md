This repo has the code of our paper, titled "**PyTorch-FEA**: Autograd-enabled Finite Element Analysis Methods
with Applications for Biomechanical Analysis of Human Aorta", which is published at computer methods and programs in biomedicine.

The free preprint is available at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.27.533816v1
It is also inside the doc folder of this repo.
